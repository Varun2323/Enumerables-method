## Bubble Sort

1. For the arrays that have one or less elements, simply return the array;

2. Create a loop that will compare each element with the next one;

3. If the first number of the compared elements is smaller, they will be swapped;

4. The loop should repeat itself until the inside interator can't be swaped;

5. Return the sorted array.
